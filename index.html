    <h3>Tangram Application</h3>
    <p>This project represents a case study in developing a GUI-based Swing application that conforms to the Entity/Boundary/Controller design paradigmn.
      The application domain is the Tangram puzzle, a two-dimensional disassembly puzzle with seven pieces that form a square.
      It contains two conceptual iterations - the first one demonstrates from scratch how to design and implement a Swing application. The second part
      refactors the original application to apply design patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>Draw Application</h3>
    <p>This project represents a case study in applying a number of design patterns to develop a GUI application similar to PowerPoint. There are 
      a number of git tags (draw.0 through draw.5) that represent the different iterations as the project was implemented.</p>
